# Chatty App Server

This repo has the server files for my Chatty App project.

Chatty App allows users to communicate with each other without having to register accounts. It uses React, a popular front-end library created and used heavily by Facebook as well as modern tools for Node including Webpack and Babel.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
2. Start the server using the `npm start` command. 
3. Continue the instructions on [chattyApp](https://github.com/ervinlouieong/chattyApp).


## Dependencies
